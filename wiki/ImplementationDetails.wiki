#summary How the change was implemented.

= Introduction =

This page gives details about the changes to the 'versions-maven-plugin'.

= Details =

The code was forked from https://svn.codehaus.org/mojo/trunk/mojo/versions-maven-plugin at revision 15873

I have relied on existing Maven project functionality (notably the maven-release-manager, also used by the maven-release-plugin) to perform the version increment functionality.

A dependency on the *maven-release-manager* has been added to the versions-maven-plugin POM, and the code changes are localised to the `org.codehaus.mojo.versions.SetMojo` class.
